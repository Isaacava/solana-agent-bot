## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Agentic Wallet (Fully Autonomous)
- Generate Solana keypairs (Ed25519 via PHP sodium)
- Sign and broadcast transactions without human input
- AES-256-GCM encrypted private key storage
- Balance-aware — knows what funds are committed vs free before any action
- Cancels tasks gracefully with friendly explanations when wallet is empty

### 🧠 Multi-AI Engine (All Free Tiers)
| Provider | Model | Speed |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Groq** | llama-3.3-70b-versatile | ⚡ Fastest |
| **Google Gemini** | gemini-2.0-flash-lite | ✅ Reliable |
| **Cohere** | command-r | ✅ Good fallback |

AI providers auto-fallback if one fails. Voice notes transcribed via **Groq Whisper**.

### 🇳🇬 Nigerian Language Support
Chat naturally in **English, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, or Pidgin** — typed or voice note — the agent understands and responds in your language.

### ⛓️ Solana Features
| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| Real-time SOL price (USD & NGN) | CoinGecko free API |
| Send SOL instantly | Solana RPC + pure PHP tx builder |
| Schedule SOL sends | Cron-based task engine |
| SOL ↔ USDC swaps (devnet) | Bot liquidity wallet — real on-chain SPL transfers |
| SOL ↔ USDC swaps (mainnet) | Jupiter Aggregator v6 |
| Conditional goals (price-triggered sends & swaps) | Cron monitors price every minute |

| Devnet SOL airdrop | Solana devnet RPC |
| Devnet USDC faucet | USDC-Dev mint |

### 🔄 DeFi — SOL ↔ USDC Swaps
Instant swaps at the live CoinGecko price. On devnet the bot runs its own liquidity wallet with real on-chain SPL token transfers — you can verify every transaction on Solana Explorer. On mainnet it routes through Jupiter for best price.

### 🎯 Conditional Goals (Price-Triggered Execution)
Set a condition and forget. The agent watches price every minute and executes automatically:

```
"Send 1 SOL to [address] when SOL hits $120"
"Swap 100 USDC to SOL when SOL drops below $75"
"Sell 0.5 SOL when price reaches $150"
"Buy $20 worth of SOL if price dips to $70"
```

If the condition fires but your wallet is empty, the agent cancels the goal and explains clearly — no silent failures, no error codes.

### 🤖 Auto Trading Strategy (Fully Autonomous)
The most autonomous feature. One confirmation from you — the agent trades for days:

```
You: "Grow my SOL" / "Set up auto trading for me"

Agent: Buy at $82.50 (−2.5% from now)
       Sell at $88.28 (+7% from entry)
       Stop loss: $80.85 (−2% from entry)
       Risk/reward: 1:3.5  — shall I activate?

You: "Oya run am" / "yes" / "do it"

→ Agent watches price every minute
→ Buys when price dips to target (USDC→SOL swap)
→ Holds and watches for sell target or stop loss
→ Exits position automatically and reports P&L
```

### 🛡️ Balance Guard (Fund Awareness)
Before any send or swap, the agent calculates your **free balance** — not just your total, but what's actually uncommitted:

| Committed to | Tracked |
|---|---|
| Pending scheduled sends | SOL reserved |
| Conditional send goals | SOL reserved |
| Conditional swap goals (SOL→USDC) | SOL reserved |
| Conditional swap goals (USDC→SOL) | USDC reserved |
| Strategy waiting to buy | USDC reserved |
| Strategy holding SOL | SOL reserved |

If you're short, the agent tells you exactly what your money is doing:

```
⚠️ Your SOL is busy!
💰 Total: 2.5 SOL
🔒 Committed: 1.5 SOL
  • Strategy #1: holding 1 SOL (selling at $92)
  • Goal: send 0.5 SOL → DtMMAwsc when SOL above $88
✅ Free: 0.99 SOL — you need 2 SOL
```

It also warns you proactively — 10 minutes before a scheduled send is due, if your balance is low, it messages you to top up in time.

### ⏰ Automation (Agentic)
- **"Alert me when SOL goes above $200"** — fires Telegram notification automatically
- **"Send 0.5 SOL to [address] in 2 hours"** — executes autonomously via cron
- **"Send 1 SOL to [address] when SOL hits $120"** — price-triggered execution
- **"Grow my SOL"** — autonomous buy/sell strategy runs for days

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Upload Files
Upload the entire project folder to your web hosting.

### Step 2 — Set Directory Permissions
```bash
chmod 755 data/
chmod -R 755 data/logs/
```

### Step 3 — Run Setup Wizard
Navigate to:
```
https://yourdomain.com/setup.php
```
Fill in:
- Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- AI API keys (Groq + Gemini recommended — both free)
- Admin username & password
- Encryption key (32 chars — **never change after wallets are created**)

This creates `agent.db` with all tables automatically.

### Step 4 — Set Up DeFi Liquidity Wallet (Devnet)
```
https://yourdomain.com/setup-defi.php
```
Or via CLI:
```bash
php setup-defi.php
```
This creates and funds the bot's liquidity wallet that powers SOL ↔ USDC swaps on devnet.

### Step 5 — Set Telegram Webhook
In Agent Management Panel → Settings → click **Set Webhook**

Or via curl:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.telegram.org/bot{TOKEN}/setWebhook" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://yourdomain.com/webhook.php"}'
```

### Step 6 — Configure Cron
```bash
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs every minute)
* * * * * php /full/path/to/cron.php >> /full/path/to/data/logs/cron.log 2>&1
```

**No shell access?** Use [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free) to call:
```
GET https://yourdomain.com/cron.php?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

### Step 7 — Test the Bot
Open Telegram, find your bot, send `/start` 🎉

```

---

## 🔄 Cron Engine

`cron.php` runs every minute and fires in this order:

1. Fetch live SOL price from CoinGecko
2. Fire price alerts that crossed their threshold
3. Execute conditional tasks (send/swap goals) whose price condition is now met
4. Advance trading strategies whose buy, sell, or stop-loss price was hit
5. Execute scheduled sends whose time has arrived
6. Proactive balance check — warn users about underfunded tasks due in the next 10 minutes

---

## 📈 Trading Strategy Flow

```
Phase 1 — waiting_buy
  Cron checks: price ≤ buy_price?
  YES → USDC→SOL swap executes → notify user → phase = holding

Phase 2 — holding
  Cron checks: price ≥ sell_price?
  YES → SOL→USDC swap executes → notify user with P&L → status = completed

  OR: price ≤ stop_loss?
  YES → SOL→USDC swap executes → notify user → status = stopped

  OR: user cancels
  → status = cancelled

  OR: USDC empty when buy triggers
  → strategy cancelled, friendly explanation sent, user asked to refill
```

## 🔐 Security Design

```
User Private Key
      │
      ▼
  [PHP sodium Ed25519 generation]
      │
      ▼
  [AES-256-GCM encrypt with 32-char key]
      │
      ▼
  [Store in SQLite — encrypted blob only]
      │
      ▼  (at transaction time only)
  [Decrypt in memory — never written to disk]
      │
      ▼
  [Sign tx bytes via sodium_crypto_sign_detached]
      │
      ▼
  [Broadcast signed tx to Solana RPC]
```

**Key management principles:**
- Private keys encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key never stored in the database — only in config
- Keys only decrypted in memory when signing a transaction
- No plaintext key ever stored on disk or logged
- Webhook requests validated via `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token`
- Agent Management Panel protected by session auth with bcrypt password

---

## 🔄 DeFi Architecture (Devnet)

The bot operates a **liquidity wallet** holding both SOL and USDC-Dev:

- **SOL → USDC:** User sends SOL to liquidity wallet → wallet sends USDC-Dev to user's ATA
- **USDC → SOL:** User sends USDC-Dev to liquidity wallet → wallet sends SOL to user

Price is live from CoinGecko on every swap. Both legs are real on-chain SPL token transactions verifiable on Solana Explorer.

> ⚠️ ATA addresses are **always queried from chain** via `getTokenAccountsByMint` — never derived in PHP. PHP GMP-based off-curve checks produce unreliable results for Solana PDA derivation.

**USDC-Dev Mint:** `Gh9ZwEmdLJ8DscKNTkTqPbNwLNNBjuSzaG9Vp2KGtKJr`

## 🛠️ Technical Notes

### Why Pure PHP?
- Zero dependency deployment — upload and run, no Composer, no NPM, no build step
- Works on any shared hosting (cPanel, Plesk, etc.)
- Entire transaction signing stack implemented from scratch in PHP

### Transaction Signing
Implements the full Solana legacy transaction wire format in PHP:
- Compact-u16 encoding for account indices
- Correct account ordering (writable signers → readonly signers → writable → readonly)
- SystemProgram::Transfer and SPL Token::Transfer instructions
- Ed25519 signing via `sodium_crypto_sign_detached`

### AI Intent System
The system prompt instructs the AI to wrap actions in `<ACTION>...</ACTION>` XML tags with a JSON payload. This is parsed server-side and routed to the correct handler — keeping AI conversation completely separate from transaction execution.

After every action executes, the bot saves a `✓`-prefixed note to chat history (e.g. `✓ swap done`) instead of the AI's trigger phrase. This prevents the AI from re-reading its own trigger and re-firing the action on the user's next casual reply.

---

## 🔒 .htaccess

The project ships with a `.htaccess` file that handles all server-level security automatically:

- **Blocks direct web access** to `data/`, `config/`, and `src/` directories — no one can download your database or config by guessing a URL
- **Blocks sensitive file types** — `.db`, `.log`, `.lock`, and `.md` files return 403 Forbidden
- **Security headers** — sets `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Referrer-Policy` on every response
- **Hides PHP errors** from browser output in production

> ⚠️ **Important:** Delete or restrict access to `setup.php` and `setup-defi.php` after your first setup run — they have no authentication.
